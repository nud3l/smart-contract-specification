# Logics and Calculi

We want to try out the following approaches to see their applicability for our approach:

- [ ] Separation logic (including concurrent separation logic)
- [ ] Temporal logic (LTL and CTL)
- [ ] Matching logic
- [ ] Symmetric interaction calculus
- [ ] Java Modelling Language style (with annotations)
- [ ] Event calculus (maybe)
